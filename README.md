first, go to ycm/stringutil dir, and run `go build`
alternatively `go build ./...` at root dir, or just use a full path `go build github.com/ycm/stringutil`
by using `go build` wont produce an output file, instead it saves the compiled package in the local build cache

next, go to ycm/helloworld dir, and run `go install`
alternatively use a full command, `go install github.com/ycm/helloworld`
it produces an executable called helloworld
